  <h1>Freelance Hourly Rate Calculator</h1>
  <p>
This freelance hourly rate calculator helps freelancers and remote workers
calculate how much they should charge per hour based on their income goals
and working hours.
</p>

<h2>How this calculator works</h2>
<p>
Enter your desired annual income, the number of weeks you plan to work in a year,
and how many hours per week you can bill clients. The calculator will show the
hourly rate you need to charge.
</p>

<h2>Example calculation</h2>
<p>
If you want to earn $60,000 per year, work 48 weeks, and bill 25 hours per week,
your required hourly rate will be calculated automatically.
</p>

<h2>Why freelancers need an hourly rate calculator</h2>
<p>
Many freelancers undercharge because they do not account for non-billable time,
holidays, or inconsistent work. This calculator helps you set a realistic rate.
</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<p>
<strong>Is this calculator country-specific?</strong><br>
No. It works globally because it is based on simple income and time calculations.
